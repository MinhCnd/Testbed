# Testbed
This is a Image Processing Testbed created with QT Creator, OpenCV & Cmake. 

In my old job I used to have access to the company's testbed which they have built up over the years. 
I have taken the good and note down the bad with me to create something for my own use, and perhaps others would find useful too.

It's still early days but I plan to implement the following features for an intial release:
_ Saving & loading images
_ Saving & loading setting files
_ Re-process button
_ Simple OpenCV processing functions( Absolute thresholding, Adaptive thresholding, Edge detection with Sobel, Line Hough, ....)
